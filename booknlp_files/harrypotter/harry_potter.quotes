1766	1832	1833	1834	The newscaster	673	" And finally , bird - watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's\ owls have been behaving very unusually today . Although owls normally\ hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight , there have been\ hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since\ sunrise . Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly\ changed their sleeping pattern . "

1876	1960	1873	1874	the weatherman	674	" I do n't know about that , but it 's not\ only the owls that have been acting oddly today . Viewers as far apart as\ Kent , Yorkshire , and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead\ of the rain I promised yesterday , they 've had a downpour of shooting\ stars ! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's\ not until next week , folks ! But I can promise a wet night tonight . "\

3221	3268	3206	3206	She	703	" I heard it . Flocks\ of owls ... shooting stars .... Well , they 're not completely stupid . They\ were bound to notice something . Shooting stars down in Kent -- I 'll bet\ that was Dedalus Diggle . He never had much sense . "\

3307	3341	3303	3304	Professor McGonagall	169	" But that 's no\ reason to lose our heads . People are being downright careless , out on\ the streets in broad daylight , not even dressed in Muggle clothes,\ swapping rumors . "\

3505	3552	3553	3554	Professor McGonagall	169	" My dear Professor , surely a sensible person like yourself can call him\ by his name ? All this ' You- Know - Who ' nonsense -- for eleven years I\ have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name:\ Voldemort . "
3572	3605	3558	3558	Dumbledore	168	" It all gets so\ confusing if we keep saying ' You - Know - Who . ' I have never seen any reason\ to be frightened of saying Voldemort 's name.\ \ "
3624	3650	3614	3615	Professor McGonagall	169	" But you 're different . Everyone knows you're\ the only one You - Know- oh , all right , Voldemort , was frightened of . "\

3662	3671	3659	3659	Dumbledore	168	" Voldemort had powers I will\ never have . "\
3673	3687	3716	3717	Professor McGonagall	169	" Only because you 're too -- well -- noble to use them . "\
3689	3714	3716	3717	Professor McGonagall	169	" It 's lucky it 's dark . I have n't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey\ told me she liked my new earmuffs . "\
3727	3758	3716	3717	Professor McGonagall	169	" The owls\ are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around . You know what\ everyone 's saying ? About why he 's disappeared ? About what finally\ stopped him?"\
3820	3822	3802	3802	she	705	" everyone "

3866	3904	3862	3862	she	705	" is that last night Voldemort\ turned up in Godric 's Hollow . He went to find the Potters . The rumor is\ that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they 're -- dead . "

4052	4057	3970	3970	she	705	" faltered Professor McGonagall . "
4099	4101	4102	4102	We	710	survive?"\ \ "

4117	4198	4102	4102	We	710	"\ \ Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her\ eyes beneath her spectacles . Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a\ golden watch from his pocket and examined it . It was a very odd watch.\ It had twelve hands but no numbers ; instead , little planets were moving\ around the edge . It must have made sense to Dumbledore , though , because\ he put it back in his pocket and said , "

4555	4573	4578	4578	you	0	it?"\ \ Professor McGonagall opened her mouth , changed her mind , swallowed , and\ then said , "

4860	4870	4855	4855	Dumbledore	168	" At last . And where did\ you get that motorcycle?"\
4872	4881	4883	4884	the giant	742	" Borrowed it , Professor Dumbledore , sit , "
4895	4911	4883	4884	the giant	742	" Young Sirius Black lent it to\ me . I 've got him , sir . "\

4920	4956	4958	4958	Dumbledore	186	" No , sir -- house was almost destroyed , but I got him out all right\ before the Muggles started swarmin ' around . He fell asleep as we was\ flyin ' over Bristol . "\

6973	7046	6968	6969	Atta boy	793	" He ruffled Dudley 's hair.\ \ At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it\ while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike , a\ video camera , a remote control airplane , sixteen new computer games , and\ a VCR . He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia\ came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.\ \ "
7052	7056	7050	7050	Vernon	197	" she said . "
7069	7174	7064	7064	She	204	" She jerked her head in Harry 's direction.\ \ Dudley 's mouth fell open in horror , but Harry 's heart gave a leap . Every\ year on Dudley 's birthday , his parents took him and a friend out for the\ day , to adventure parks , hamburger restaurants , or the movies . Every\ year , Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg , a mad old lady who lived two\ streets away . Harry hated it there . The whole house smelled of cabbage\ and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she 'd ever\ owned.\ \ "
7178	7240	7064	7064	She	204	" said Aunt Petunia , looking furiously at Harry as though he'd\ planned this . Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had\ broken her leg , but it was n't easy when he reminded himself it would be\ a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles , Snowy , Mr. Paws , and\ Tufty again.\ \ "
7246	7251	7244	7244	Marge	198	" Uncle Vernon suggested.\ \ "
7264	7300	7259	7259	she	198	"\ \ The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this , as though he wasn't\ there -- or rather , as though he was something very nasty that couldn't\ understand them , like a slug.\ \ "

7547	7555	7556	7556	He	800	" Dudley yelled between huge,\ pretend sobs . "
7562	7585	7556	7556	He	800	" He shot Harry a nasty\ grin through the gap in his mother 's arms.\ \ Just then , the doorbell rang -- "
7595	7732	7733	7733	I	0	" said Aunt\ Petunia frantically -- and a moment later , Dudley 's best friend , Piers\ Polkiss , walked in with his mother . Piers was a scrawny boy with a face\ like a rat . He was usually the one who held people 's arms behind their\ backs while Dudley hit them . Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.\ \ Half an hour later , Harry , who could n't believe his luck , was sitting in\ the back of the Dursleys ' car with Piers and Dudley , on the way to the\ zoo for the first time in his life . His aunt and uncle had n't been able\ to think of anything else to do with him , but before they 'd left , Uncle\ Vernon had taken Harry aside.\ \ "

9034	9052	9012	9012	It	841	" Harry murmured through the glass , though he was n't sure the\ snake could hear him . "

9204	9329	9202	9202	you	149	" he said , punching Harry in the ribs . Caught by\ surprise , Harry fell hard on the concrete floor . What came next happened\ so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second , Piers and Dudley were\ leaning right up close to the glass , the next , they had leapt back with\ howls of horror.\ \ Harry sat up and gasped ; the glass front of the boa constrictor 's tank\ had vanished . The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly , slithering\ out onto the floor . People throughout the reptile house screamed and\ started running for the exits.\ \ As the snake slid swiftly past him , Harry could have sworn a low,\ hissing voice said , "
9340	9352	9338	9338	amigo	843	"\ \ The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.\ \ "
9357	9362	9338	9338	amigo	843	" he kept saying , "
9367	9479	9480	9480	Harry	149	go?"\ \ The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong , sweet tea\ while he apologized over and over again . Piers and Dudley could only\ gibber . As far as Harry had seen , the snake had n't done anything except\ snap playfully at their heels as it passed , but by the time they were\ all back in Uncle Vernon 's car , Dudley was telling them how it had\ nearly bitten off his leg , while Piers was swearing it had tried to\ squeeze him to death . But worst of all , for Harry at least , was Piers\ calming down enough to say , "
9489	9521	9338	9338	amigo	843	Harry?"\ \ Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before\ starting on Harry . He was so angry he could hardly speak . He managed to\ say , "
9531	10231	10232	10232	They	845	" before he collapsed into a\ chair , and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.\ \ Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later , wishing he had a watch . He\ did n't know what time it was and he could n't be sure the Dursleys were\ asleep yet . Until they were , he could n't risk sneaking to the kitchen\ for some food.\ \ He 'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years , ten miserable years , as\ long as he could remember , ever since he 'd been a baby and his parents\ had died in that car crash . He could n't remember being in the car when\ his parents had died . Sometimes , when he strained his memory during long\ hours in his cupboard , he came up with a strange vision : a blinding\ flash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his forehead . This , he\ supposed , was the crash , though he could n't imagine where all the green\ light came from . He could n't remember his parents at all . His aunt and\ uncle never spoke about them , and of course he was forbidden to ask\ questions . There were no photographs of them in the house.\ \ When he had been younger , Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown\ relation coming to take him away , but it had never happened ; the\ Dursleys were his only family . Yet sometimes he thought ( or maybe hoped)\ that strangers in the street seemed to know him . Very strange strangers\ they were , too . A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once\ while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley . After asking Harry\ furiously if he knew the man , Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the\ shop without buying anything . A wild - looking old woman dressed all in\ green had waved merrily at him once on a bus . A bald man in a very long\ purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and\ then walked away without a word . The weirdest thing about all these\ people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a\ closer look.\ \ At school , Harry had no one . Everybody knew that Dudley 's gang hated\ that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses , and\ nobody liked to disagree with Dudley 's gang.\ \ \ CHAPTER THREE\ \ THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE\ \ The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his\ longest - ever punishment . By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard\ again , the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his\ new video camera , crashed his remote control airplane , and , first time\ out on his racing bike , knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet\ Drive on her crutches.\ \ Harry was glad school was over , but there was no escaping Dudley 's gang,\ who visited the house every single day . Piers , Dennis , Malcolm , and\ Gordon were all big and stupid , but as Dudley was the biggest and\ stupidest of the lot , he was the leader . The rest of them were all quite\ happy to join in Dudley 's favorite sport : Harry Hunting.\ \ This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house,\ wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays , where he\ could see a tiny ray of hope . When September came he would be going off\ to secondary school and , for the first time in his life , he would n't be\ with Dudley . Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon 's old private\ school , Smeltings . Piers Polkiss was going there too . Harry , on the\ other hand , was going to Stonewall High , the local public school . Dudley\ thought this was very funny.\ \ "
10244	10249	9480	9480	Harry	149	Stonewall,"\ he told Harry . "
10255	10257	9480	9480	Harry	149	practice?"\ \ "
10262	10266	9480	9480	Harry	149	" said Harry . "
10287	10580	9480	9480	Harry	149	" Then he ran , before\ Dudley could work out what he 'd said.\ \ One day in July , Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings\ uniform , leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg 's . Mrs. Figg wasn ' t as bad as\ usual . It turned out she 'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats,\ and she did n't seem quite as fond of them as before . She let Harry watch\ television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though\ she 'd had it for several years.\ \ That evening , Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in\ his brand - new uniform . Smeltings ' boys wore maroon tailcoats , orange\ knickerbockers , and flat straw hats called boaters . They also carried\ knobbly sticks , used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't\ looking . This was supposed to be good training for later life.\ \ As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers , Uncle Vernon said\ gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life . Aunt Petunia burst\ into tears and said she could n't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins , he\ looked so handsome and grown - up . Harry did n't trust himself to speak . He\ thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to\ laugh.\ \ There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry\ went in for breakfast . It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in\ the sink . He went to have a look . The tub was full of what looked like\ dirty rags swimming in gray water.\ \ "
10585	10606	10607	10607	Your	850	" he asked Aunt Petunia . Her lips tightened as they always\ did if he dared to ask a question.\ \ "
10612	10623	10607	10607	Your	850	" she said.\ \ Harry looked in the bowl again.\ \ "
10626	10630	10607	10607	Your	850	" he said , "
10642	10644	10631	10631	I	0	"\ \ "
10649	10654	10631	10631	I	0	" snapped Aunt Petunia . "
10680	10792	10797	10797	Dudley	152	"\ \ Harry seriously doubted this , but thought it best not to argue . He sat\ down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look\ on his first day at Stonewall High -- like he was wearing bits of old\ elephant skin , probably.\ \ Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in , both with wrinkled noses because of the\ smell from Harry 's new uniform . Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as\ usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick , which he carried everywhere,\ on the table.\ \ They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the\ doormat.\ \ "
10799	10808	10797	10797	Dudley	152	" said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.\ \ "
10814	10816	10821	10821	Harry	149	"\ \ "

10843	11067	10841	10841	Dudley	152	"\ \ Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail . Three things\ lay on the doormat : a postcard from Uncle Vernon 's sister Marge , who was\ vacationing on the Isle of Wight , a brown envelope that looked like a\ bill , and -- a letter for Harry.\ \ Harry picked it up and stared at it , his heart twanging like a giant\ elastic band . No one , ever , in his whole life , had written to him . Who\ would ? He had no friends , no other relatives -- he did n't belong to the\ library , so he 'd never even got rude notes asking for books back . Yet\ here it was , a letter , addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:\ \ Mr. H. Potter\ \ The Cupboard under the Stairs\ \ 4 Privet Drive\ \ Little Whinging\ \ Surrey\ \ The envelope was thick and heavy , made of yellowish parchment , and the\ address was written in emerald - green ink . There was no stamp.\ \ Turning the envelope over , his hand trembling , Harry saw a purple wax\ seal bearing a coat of arms ; a lion , an eagle , a badger , and a snake\ surrounding a large letter H.\ \ "
11073	11081	11071	11071	boy	807	" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen . "
11092	11152	11153	11153	Marge	198	" He chuckled at his own joke.\ \ Harry went back to the kitchen , still staring at his letter . He handed\ Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard , sat down , and slowly began to\ open the yellow envelope.\ \ Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill , snorted in disgust , and flipped over\ the postcard.\ \ "
11157	11163	11153	11153	Marge	198	" he informed Aunt Petunia . "
11169	11171	11172	11172	Dad	853	--."\ \ "
11174	11179	11180	11180	Dad	853	" said Dudley suddenly . "
11185	11222	11182	11182	Harry	149	something!"\ \ Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter , which was written on the\ same heavy parchment as the envelope , when it was jerked sharply out of\ his hand by Uncle Vernon.\ \ "
11227	11237	11182	11182	Harry	149	" said Harry , trying to snatch it back.\ \ "
11245	11295	11182	11182	Harry	149	" sneered Uncle Vernon , shaking the letter open\ with one hand and glancing at it . His face went from red to green faster\ than a set of traffic lights . And it did n't stop there . Within seconds\ it was the grayish white of old porridge.\ \ "
11302	11359	11360	11360	Vernon	197	" he gasped.\ \ Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it , but Uncle Vernon held it\ high out of his reach . Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first\ line . For a moment it looked as though she might faint . She clutched her\ throat and made a choking noise.\ \ "
11366	11411	11412	11412	I	0	Vernon!"\ \ They stared at each other , seeming to have forgotten that Harry and\ Dudley were still in the room . Dudley was n't used to being ignored . He\ gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.\ \ "

11490	11567	11568	11568	Vernon	197	" roared Uncle Vernon , and he took both Harry and Dudley by the\ scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall , slamming the\ kitchen door behind them . Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but\ silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole ; Dudley won , so Harry,\ his glasses dangling from one ear , lay flat on his stomach to listen at\ the crack between door and floor.\ \ "
11570	11580	11568	11568	Vernon	197	" Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice , "

11866	11910	11846	11846	He	197	" Er -- yes , Harry -- about this cupboard . Your aunt and I have been\ thinking ... you 're really getting a bit big for it ... we think it might\ be nice if you moved into Dudley 's second bedroom.\ \ "
11913	11917	11846	11846	He	197	" said Harry.\ \ "
11923	11928	11846	11846	He	197	" snapped his uncle . "
11935	12178	12180	12180	Harry	149	"\ \ The Dursleys ' house had four bedrooms : one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt\ Petunia , one for visitors ( usually Uncle Vernon 's sister , Marge ) , one\ where Dudley slept , and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things\ that would n't fit into his first bedroom . It only took Harry one trip\ upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room . He\ sat down on the bed and stared around him . Nearly everything in here was\ broken . The month - old video camera was lying on top of a small , working\ tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor 's dog ; in the\ corner was Dudley 's first - ever television set , which he 'd put his foot\ through when his favorite program had been canceled ; there was a large\ birdcage , which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school\ for a real air rifle , which was up on a shelf with the end all bent\ because Dudley had sat on it . Other shelves were full of books . They\ were the only things in the room that looked as though they 'd never been\ touched.\ \ From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother , I don't\ want him in there ... I need that room ... make him get out .... "\

As they\ could n't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door,\ slotted through the sides , and a few even forced through the small\ window in the downstairs bathroom.\ \ Uncle Vernon stayed at home again . After burning all the letters , he got\ out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and\ back doors so no one could go out . He hummed "
12980	13073	12856	12856	Petunia	165	Tulips"\ as he worked , and jumped at small noises.\ \ On Saturday , things began to get out of hand . Twenty - four letters to\ Harry found their way into the house , rolled up and hidden inside each\ of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt\ Petunia through the living room window . While Uncle Vernon made furious\ telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone\ to complain to , Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.\ \ "
13085	13113	12856	12856	Petunia	165	" Dudley asked Harry in\ amazement.\ \ On Sunday morning , Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking\ tired and rather ill , but happy.\ \ "

13137	13191	12856	12856	Petunia	165	--"\ \ Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught\ him sharply on the back of the head .

13194	13249	12856	12856	Petunia	165	OUT!"\ \ Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall.\ When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their\ faces , Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut .

13699	13790	13697	13697	dear	2451	" Aunt Petunia suggested\ timidly , hours later , but Uncle Vernon did n't seem to hear her . Exactly\ what he was looking for , none of them knew . He drove them into the\ middle of a forest , got out , looked around , shook his head , got back in\ the car , and off they went again . The same thing happened in the middle\ of a plowed field , halfway across a suspension bridge , and at the top of\ a multilevel parking garage.\ \ "
13800	13847	13798	13798	he	200	" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that\ afternoon . Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast , locked them all inside\ the car , and disappeared.\ \ It started to rain . Great drops beat on the roof of the car . Dud ley\ sniveled.\ \ "

13875	13989	13861	13861	Humberto	230	" \ \ Monday . This reminded Harry of something . If it was Monday -- and you\ could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week , because of\ television -- then tomorrow , Tuesday , was Harry 's eleventh birthday . Of\ course , his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year , the Dursleys\ had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon 's old socks.\ Still , you were n't eleven every day.\ \ Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling . He was also carrying a long,\ thin package and did n't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd\ bought.\ \ "
13995	13999	13861	13861	Humberto	230	" he said . "
14004	14058	13861	13861	Humberto	230	out!"\ \ It was very cold outside the car . Uncle Vernon was pointing at what\ looked like a large rock way out at sea . Perched on top of the rock was\ the most miserable little shack you could imagine . One thing was\ certain , there was no television in there.\ \ "
14064	14075	14077	14078	this gentleman	906	" said Uncle Vernon gleefully , clapping his\ hands together . "
14086	14120	14121	14121	I	0	boat!"\ \ A toothless old man came ambling up to them , pointing , with a rather\ wicked grin , at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron - gray water below\ them.\ \ "

14137	14260	14077	14078	this gentleman	906	aboard!"\ \ It was freezing in the boat . Icy sea spray and rain crept down their\ necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces . After what seemed like\ hours they reached the rock , where Uncle Vernon , slipping and sliding,\ led the way to the broken - down house.\ \ The inside was horrible ; it smelled strongly of seaweed , the wind\ whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls , and the fireplace was\ damp and empty . There were only two rooms.\ \ Uncle Vernon 's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four\ bananas . He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked\ and shriveled up.\ \ "
14272	14710	14773	14773	I	0	" he said cheerfully.\ \ He was in a very good mood . Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance\ of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail . Harry privately\ agreed , though the thought did n't cheer him up at all.\ \ As night fell , the promised storm blew up around them . Spray from the\ high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the\ filthy windows . Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second\ room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth - eaten sofa . She and Uncle\ Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door , and Harry was left to find\ the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest,\ most ragged blanket.\ \ The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on . Harry\ could n't sleep . He shivered and turned over , trying to get comfortable,\ his stomach rumbling with hunger . Dudley 's snores were drowned by the\ low rolls of thunder that started near midnight . The lighted dial of\ Dudley 's watch , which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat\ wrist , told Harry he 'd be eleven in ten minutes ' time . He lay and\ watched his birthday tick nearer , wondering if the Dursleys would\ remember at all , wondering where the letter writer was now.\ \ Five minutes to go . Harry heard something creak outside . He hoped the\ roof was n't going to fall in , although he might be warmer if it did.\ Four minutes to go . Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of\ letters when they got back that he 'd be able to steal one somehow.\ \ Three minutes to go . Was that the sea , slapping hard on the rock like\ that ? And ( two minutes to go ) what was that funny crunching noise ? Was\ the rock crumbling into the sea?\ \ One minute to go and he 'd be eleven . Thirty seconds ... twenty ... ten ... \ nine -- maybe he 'd wake Dudley up , just to annoy him -- three ... two ... \ one ... \ \ BOOM.\ \ The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright , staring at the\ door . Someone was outside , knocking to come in.\ \ \ CHAPTER FOUR\ \ THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS\ \ BOOM . They knocked again . Dudley jerked awake . "
14716	14763	14773	14773	I	0	" he\ said stupidly.\ \ There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the\ room . He was holding a rifle in his hands -- now they knew what had been\ in the long , thin package he had brought with them.\ \ "

Then --\ \ SMASH!\ \ The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and\ with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.\ \ A giant of a man was standing in the doorway . His face was almost\ completely hidden by a long , shaggy mane of hair and a wild , tangled\ beard , but you could make out his eyes , glinting like black beetles\ under all the hair.\ \ The giant squeezed his way into the hut , stooping so that his head just\ brushed the ceiling . He bent down , picked up the door , and fitted it\ easily back into its frame . The noise of the storm outside dropped a\ little . He turned to look at them all.\ \ "

35981	35988	35966	35966	Ye	0	" Hagrid called over\ his shoulder , "

36165	36239	36088	36088	Everyone	2460	" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff ; they\ all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain\ of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face .

36250	36266	36267	36267	Trevor	345	" said Hagrid , who was checking the\ boats as people climbed out of them.\ \ "

Harry\ could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right\ -the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall\ showed the first years into a small , empty chamber off the hall . They\ crowded in , standing rather closer together than they would usually have\ done , peering about nervously.\ \ "

36890	37071	36886	36886	he\	300	"\ \ Harry 's heart gave a horrible jolt . A test ? In front of the whole\ school ? But he did n't know any magic yet -- what on earth would he have\ to do ? He had n't expected something like this the moment they arrived.\ He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified,\ too . No one was talking much except Hermione Granger , who was whispering\ very fast about all the spells she 'd learned and wondering which one\ she 'd need . Harry tried hard not to listen to her . He 'd never been more\ nervous , never , not even when he 'd had to take a school report home to\ the Dursleys saying that he 'd somehow turned his teacher 's wig blue . He\ kept his eyes fixed on the door . Any second now , Professor McGonagall\ would come back and lead him to his doom.\ \ Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air --\ several people behind him screamed.\ \ "
37074	37136	37141	37141	I	0	--?"\ \ He gasped . So did the people around him . About twenty ghosts had just\ streamed through the back wall . Pearly - white and slightly transparent,\ they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing\ at the first years . They seemed to be arguing . What looked like a fat\ little monk was saying : "

37197	37216	37194	37194	you	346	here?"\ \ A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.\ \ Nobody answered.\ \ "

37274	37280	37250	37250	you	346	" said a sharp voice . "

37316	37324	37250	37250	you	346	" Professor McGonagall told the first years , "
37329	37534	37250	37250	you	346	"\ \ Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead , Harry got into line\ behind a boy with sandy hair , with Ron behind him , and they walked out\ of the chamber , back across the hall , and through a pair of double doors\ into the Great Hall.\ \ Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place . It was\ lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair\ over four long tables , where the rest of the students were sitting.\ These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets . At the\ top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.\ Professor McGonagall led the first years up here , so that they came to a\ halt in a line facing the other students , with the teachers behind them.\ The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the\ flickering candlelight . Dotted here and there among the students , the\ ghosts shone misty silver . Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes , Harry\ looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars . He\ heard\ \ Hermione whisper , "
37554	37715	37544	37544	I	0	"\ \ It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all , and that the\ Great Hall did n't simply open on to the heavens.\ \ Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed\ a four - legged stool in front of the first years . On top of the stool she\ put a pointed wizard 's hat . This hat was patched and frayed and\ extremely dirty . Aunt Petunia would n't have let it in the house.\ \ Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it , Harry thought wildly,\ that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was\ now staring at the hat , he stared at it , too . For a few seconds , there\ was complete silence . Then the hat twitched . A rip near the brim opened\ wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing:\ \ "
37942	37972	37938	37938	I	0	Cap!"\ \ The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song . It\ bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.\ \ "

38004	38103	37995	37995	he	300	"\ \ Harry . smiled weakly . Yes , trying on the hat was a lot better than\ having to do a spell , but he did wish they could have tried it on\ without everyone watching . The hat seemed to be asking rather alot;\ Harry did n't feel brave or quick - witted or any of it at the moment . If\ only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy,\ that would have been the one for him.\ \ Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of\ parchment.\ \ "
38125	38129	38130	38130	Abbott	348	" she said . "
38132	38169	38130	38130	Abbott	348	Hannah!"\ \ A pink - faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line , put on the\ hat , which fell right down over her eyes , and sat down . A moments pause\ --\ \ "
38172	38209	38210	38210	Bones	243	" shouted the hat.\ \ The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at\ the Hufflepuff table . Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving\ merrily at her.\ \ "

38217	38233	38234	38234	Boot	354	" shouted the hat again , and Susan scuttled off to sit next\ to Hannah.\ \ "

38279	38306	38277	38277	Brown	361	Lavender"\ became the first new Gryffindor , and the table on the far left exploded\ with cheers ; Harry could see Ron 's twin brothers catcalling.\ \ "
38310	38389	38390	38392	Finch - Fletchley	362	" then became a Slytherin . Perhaps it was Harry's\ imagination , after all he 'd heard about Slytherin , but he thought they\ looked like an unpleasant lot . He was starting to feel definitely sick\ now . He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school.\ He had always been last to be chosen , not because he was no good , but\ because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.\ \ "

38397	38424	38425	38425	Finnigan	365	HUFFLEPUFF!"\ \ Sometimes , Harry noticed , the hat shouted out the house at once , but at\ others it took a little while to decide . "
38429	38459	38460	38460	Granger	334	" the\ sandy - haired boy next to Harry in the line , sat on the stool for almost\ a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.\ \ "
38462	38479	38460	38460	Granger	334	Hermione!"\ \ Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.\ \ "
38482	38597	38460	38460	Granger	334	" shouted the hat . Ron groaned.\ \ A horrible thought struck Harry , as horrible thoughts always do when\ you 're very nervous . What if he was n't chosen at all ? What if he just\ sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages , until Professor\ McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a\ mistake and he 'd better get back on the train?\ \ When Neville Longbottom , the boy who kept losing his toad , was called,\ he fell over on his way to the stool . The hat took a long time to decide\ with Neville . When it finally shouted , "

38876	38882	38872	38872	Slytherin	283	" said the small voice . "
38930	39001	39002	39002	We	1466	GRYFFINDOR!"\ \ Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall . He took off\ the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table . He was so\ relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin , he hardly noticed\ that he was getting the loudest cheer yet . Percy the Prefect got up and\ shook his hand vigorously , while the Weasley twins yelled , "
39010	39181	39182	39182	Thomas	263	" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff\ he 'd seen earlier . The ghost patted his arm , giving Harry the sudden,\ horrible feeling he 'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice - cold water.\ \ He could see the High Table properly now . At the end nearest him sat\ Hagrid , who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up . Harry grinned\ back . And there , in the center of the High Table , in a large gold chair,\ sat Albus Dumbledore . Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd\ gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train . Dumbledore 's silver hair\ was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the\ ghosts . Harry spotted Professor Quirtell , too , the nervous young man\ from the Leaky Cauldron . He was looking very peculiar in a large purple\ turban.\ \ And now there were only three people left to be sorted . "
39184	39199	39182	39182	Thomas	263	Dean,"\ a Black boy even taller than Ron , joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.\ "
39204	39239	39202	39202	Lisa	320	" became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron 's turn . He was\ pale green by now . Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a\ second later the hat had shouted , "
39240	39258	39182	39182	Thomas	263	GRYFFINDOR!"\ \ Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next\ to him.\ \ "
39266	39274	39262	39262	Ron	468	" said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry\ as "
39279	39358	39277	39277	Blaise	381	" was made a Slytherin . Professor McGonagall rolled\ up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.\ \ Harry looked down at his empty gold plate . He had only just realized how\ hungry he was . The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.\ \ Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet . He was beaming at the students,\ his arms opened wide , as if nothing could have pleased him more than to\ see them all there.\ \ "
39361	39365	39262	39262	Ron	468	" he said . "

39758	39780	39755	39755	you	169	headless?"\ \ Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed , as if their little chat wasn't\ going at all the way he wanted.\ \ "
39784	39856	39755	39755	you	169	" he said irritably . He seized his left ear and pulled . His\ whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on\ a hinge . Someone had obviously tried to behead him , but not done it\ properly . Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces , Nearly\ Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck , coughed , and said,\ "
39911	39968	39905	39905	he	1476	"\ \ Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost\ sitting there , with blank staring eyes , a gaunt face , and robes stained\ with silver blood . He was right next to Malfoy who , Harry was pleased to\ see , did n't look too pleased with the seating arrangements.\ \ "
39977	39984	39985	39985	I	0	" asked Seamus with great interest.\ \ "
39990	40066	39985	39985	I	0	" said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.\ \ When everyone had eaten as much as they could , the remains of the food\ faded from the plates , leaving them sparkling clean as before .

People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look\ at him , or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again , staring.\ Harry wished they would n't , because he was trying to concentrate on\ finding his way to classes.\ \ There were a hundred and forty - two staircases at Hogwarts : wide,\ sweeping ones ; narrow , rickety ones ; some that led somewhere different\ on a Friday ; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to\ remember to jump . Then there were doors that would n't open unless you\ asked politely , or tickled them in exactly the right place , and doors\ that were n't really doors at all , but solid walls just pretending . It\ was also very hard to remember where anything was , because it all seemed\ to move around a lot . The people in the portraits kept going to visit\ each other , and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.\ \ The ghosts did n't help , either . It was always a nasty shock when one of\ them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open . Nearly\ Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right\ direction , but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a\ trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class . He would\ drop wastepaper baskets on your head , pull rugs from under your feet,\ pelt you with bits of chalk , or sneak up behind you , invisible , grab\ your nose , and screech , "
42265	42791	42264	42264	YOUR	1522	CONK!"\ \ Even worse than Peeves , if that was possible , was the caretaker , Argus\ Filch . Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their\ very first morning . Filch found them trying to force their way through a\ door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out - of - bounds\ corridor on the third floor . He would n't believe they were lost , was\ sure they were trying to break into it on purpose , and was threatening\ to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor\ Quirrell , who was passing.\ \ Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris , a scrawny , dust - colored creature\ with bulging , lamp like eyes just like Filch 's . She patrolled the\ corridors alone . Break a rule in front of her , put just one toe out of\ line , and she 'd whisk off for Filch , who 'd appear , wheezing , two seconds\ later . Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than\ anyone ( except perhaps the Weasley twins ) and could pop up as suddenly\ as any of the ghosts . The students all hated him , and it was the dearest\ ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.\ \ And then , once you had managed to find them , there were the classes\ themselves . There was a lot more to magic , as Harry quickly found out,\ than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.\ \ They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every\ Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the\ movements of the planets . Three times a week they went out to the\ greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology , with a dumpy little\ witch called Professor Sprout , where they learned how to take care of\ all the strange plants and fungi , and found out what they were used for.\ \ Easily the most boring class was History of Magic , which was the only\ one taught by a ghost . Professor Binns had been very old\ \ indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got\ up next morning to teach , leaving his body behind him . Binns droned on\ and on while they scribbled down names and dates , and got Emetic the\ Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.\ \ Professor Flitwick , the Charms teacher , was a tiny little wizard who had\ to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk . At the start of their\ first class he took the roll call , and when he reached Harry 's name he\ gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.\ \ Professor McGonagall was again different . Harry had been quite right to\ think she was n't a teacher to cross . Strict and clever , she gave them a\ talking - to the moment they sat down in her first class.\ \ "
42808	42812	42264	42264	YOUR	1522	" she said . "
42831	43198	42826	42826	You	1523	"\ \ Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again . They were all very\ impressed and could n't wait to get started , but soon realized they\ were n't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time.\ After taking a lot of complicated notes , they were each given a match\ and started trying to turn it into a needle . By the end of the lesson,\ only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match ; Professor\ McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and\ gave Hermione a rare smile.\ \ The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense\ Against the Dark Arts , but Quirrell 's lessons turned out to be a bit of\ a joke . His classroom smelled strongly of garlic , which everyone said\ was to ward off a vampire he 'd met in Romania and was afraid would be\ coming back to get him one of these days . His turban , he told them , had\ been given to him by an African prince as a thank - you for getting rid of\ a troublesome zombie , but they were n't sure they believed this story.\ For one thing , when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell\ had fought off the zombie , Quirrell went pink and started talking about\ the weather ; for another , they had noticed that a funny smell hung\ around the turban , and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed\ full of garlic as well , so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.\ \ Harry was very relieved to find out that he was n't miles behind everyone\ else . Lots of people had come from Muggle families and , like him , hadn't\ had any idea that they were witches and wizards . There was so much to\ learn that even people like Ron did n't have much of a head start.\ \ Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron . They finally managed to\ find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost\ once.\ \ "
43205	43217	42826	42826	You	1523	" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his\ porridge.\ \ "
43224	43228	43229	43229	Snape	392	" said Ron . "
43254	43256	43236	43236	They	1527	"\ \ "
43262	43654	43258	43258	McGonagall	169	" said Harry . Professor McGonagall was head\ of Gryffindor House , but it had n't stopped her from giving them a huge\ pile of homework the day before.\ \ Just then , the mail arrived . Harry had gotten used to this by now , but\ it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning , when about a\ hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast,\ circling the tables until they saw their owners , and dropping letters\ and packages onto their laps.\ \ Hedwig had n't brought Harry anything so far . She sometimes flew in to\ nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the\ owlery with the other school owls . This morning , however , she fluttered\ down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto\ Harry 's plate . Harry tore it open at once . It said , in a very untidy\ scrawl:\ \ \ Dear Harry,\ \ I know you get Friday afternoons off , so would you like to come and have\ a cup of tea with me around three?\ \ I want to hear all about your first week . Send us an answer back with\ Hedwig.\ \ Hagrid\ \ \ Harry borrowed Ron 's quill , scribbled Yes , please , see you later on the\ back of the note , and sent Hedwig off again.\ \ It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to , because\ the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to\ him so far.\ \ At the start - of - term banquet , Harry had gotten the idea that Professor\ Snape disliked him . By the end of the first Potions lesson , he knew he'd\ been wrong . Snape did n't dislike Harry -- he hated him.\ \ Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons . It was colder\ here than up in the main castle , and would have been quite creepy enough\ without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.\ \ Snape , like Flitwick , started the class by taking the roll call , and\ like Flitwick , he paused at Harry 's name.\ \ "
43659	43664	43665	43666	Harry Potter	149	" he said softly , "
43673	43729	43258	43258	McGonagall	169	"\ \ Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their\ hands . Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class . His\ eyes were black like Hagrid 's , but they had none of Hagrid 's warmth.\ They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.\ \ "
43744	43790	43730	43730	You	1530	" he began . He spoke in barely more than a whisper , but\ they caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall , Snape had y caught\ every word -- like Professor McGonagall , Snape had the gift of keeping a\ class silent without effort . "
43882	43922	43923	43923	Potter	149	"\ \ More silence followed this little speech . Harry and Ron exchanged looks\ with raised eyebrows . Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and\ looked desperate to start proving that she was n't a dunderhead.\ \ "
43925	43930	43923	43923	Potter	149	" said Snape suddenly . "
43946	43980	43923	43923	Potter	149	wormwood?"\ \ Powdered root of what to an infusion of what ? Harry glanced at Ron , who\ looked as stumped as he was ; Hermione 's hand had shot into the air.\ \ "
43988	44000	43981	43981	I	0	" said Harry.\ \ Snape 's lips curled into a sneer.\ \ "

44039	44092	44093	44093	I	0	bezoar?"\ \ Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without\ her leaving her seat , but Harry did n't have the faintest idea what a\ bezoar was . He tried not to look at Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle , who were\ shaking with laughter.\ \ "
44100	44101	44093	44093	I	0	" "
44115	44164	44113	44113	Potter	149	" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those\ cold eyes . He had looked through his books at the Dursleys ' , but did\ Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs\ and Fungi?\ \ Snape was still ignoring Hermione 's quivering hand.\ \ "
44175	44192	44193	44193	I	0	wolfsbane?"\ \ At this , Hermione stood up , her hand stretching toward the dungeon\ ceiling.\ \ "
44198	44203	44193	44193	I	0	" said Harry quietly . "
44216	44240	44214	44214	you	149	her?"\ \ A few people laughed ; Harry caught Seamus 's eye , and Seamus winked.\ Snape , however , was not pleased.\ \ "
44244	44250	44214	44214	you	149	" he snapped at Hermione . "
44326	44344	44322	44322	you	149	down?"\ \ There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment . Over the noise,\ Snape said , "
44360	44527	44528	44529	Idiot boy	1535	"\ \ Things did n't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson\ continued . Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a\ simple potion to cure boils . He swept around in his long black cloak,\ watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs , criticizing\ almost everyone except Malfoy , whom he seemed to like . He was just\ telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned\ slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the\ dungeon . Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus 's cauldron into a\ twisted blob , and their potion was seeping across the stone floor,\ burning holes in people 's shoes . Within seconds , the whole class was\ standing on their stools while Neville , who had been drenched in the\ potion when the cauldron collapsed , moaned in pain as angry red boils\ sprang up all over his arms and legs.\ \ "
44531	44547	44528	44529	Idiot boy	1535	" snarled Snape , clearing the spilled potion away with one\ wave of his wand . "
44561	44576	44578	44578	him	1536	fire?"\ \ Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.\ \ "
44585	44607	44608	44608	You	1536	" Snape spat at Seamus . Then he\ rounded on Harry and Ron , who had been working next to Neville.\ \ "
44650	44672	44615	44615	you	1536	"\ \ This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue , but Ron kicked\ him behind their cauldron.\ \ "

44692	44739	44686	44686	Snape	392	"\ \ As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later , Harry 's mind\ was racing and his spirits were low . He 'd lost two points for Gryffindor\ in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much ? "
44741	44745	44746	44746	Snape	392	up,"\ said Ron , "
44763	44833	44836	44836	Fang\	410	you?"\ \ At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the\ grounds . Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the\ forbidden forest . A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the\ front door.\ \ When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and\ several booming barks . Then Hagrid 's voice rang out , saying , "
44840	44859	44836	44836	Fang\	410	"\ \ Hagrid 's big , hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door\ open.\ \ "
44863	44867	44870	44870	Fang	411	" he said . "
44872	44934	44870	44870	Fang	411	"\ \ He let them in , struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous\ black boarhound.\ \ There was only one room inside . Hams and pheasants were hanging from the\ ceiling , a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire , and in the corner\ stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.\ \ "
44940	44973	44870	44870	Fang	411	" said Hagrid , letting go of Fang , who bounded\ straight at Ron and started licking his ears . Like Hagrid , Fang was\ clearly not as fierce as he looked.\ \ "
44978	45000	44976	44976	Ron	468	" Harry told Hagrid , who was pouring boiling water into a\ large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.\ \ "
45006	45031	44870	44870	Fang	411	" said Hagrid , glancing at Ron 's freckles . I spent\ half me life chasin ' yer twin brothers away from the forest . "\

In the meantime , Harry filled Ron in about the\ package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts , and\ they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy\ protection .

All Neville cared about was never\ going near the dog again.\ \ Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron , but she was such a\ bossy know - it - all that they saw this as an added bonus . All they really\ wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy , and to their great\ delight , just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\ \ As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual , everyone 's attention\ was caught at once by a long , thin package carried by six large screech\ owls . Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in\ this large parcel , and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped\ it right in front of him , knocking his bacon to the floor . They had\ hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top\ of the parcel.\ \ Harry ripped open the letter first , which was lucky , because it said:\ \ \ DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\ \ It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand , but I do n't want everybody\ knowing you 've got a broomstick or they 'll all want one . Oliver Wood\ will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your\ first training session.\ \ Professor McGonagall\ \ Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to\ read.\ \ "

Sleek and shiny , with a mahogany handle , it had a long\ tail of neat , straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold\ near the top.\ \ As seven o'clock drew nearer , Harry left the castle and set off in the\ dusk toward the Quidditch field . Held never been inside the stadium\ before . Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that\ the spectators were high enough to see what was going on . At either end\ of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end . They\ reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle\ \ children blew bubbles through , except that they were fifty feet high.\ \ Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood , Harry mounted his broomstick\ and kicked off from the ground . What a feeling -- he swooped in and out\ of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field . The Nimbus Two\ Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\ \ "

53241	53275	53239	53239	Wood	428	" Now , Quidditch is easy enough to understand , even\ if it 's not too easy to play . There are seven players on each side.\ Three of them are called Chasers . "\

It 's the Seeker 's job to catch it . You 've got to weave\ in and out of the Chasers , Beaters , Bludgers , and Quaffle to get it\ before the other team 's Seeker , because whichever Seeker catches the\ Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points , so they\ \ nearly always win . That 's why Seekers get fouled so much . A game of\ Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught , so it can go on for ages\ -- I think the record is three months , they had to keep bringing on\ substitutes so the players could get some sleep .

His\ lessons , too , were becoming more and more interesting now that they had\ mastered the basics.\ \ On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin\ wafting through the corridors .

Professor Flitwick put the\ class into pairs to practice . Harry 's partner was Seamus Finnigan ( which\ was a relief , because Neville had been trying to catch his eye ) .

Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left,\ something huge was moving toward them . They shrank into the shadows and\ watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.\ \ It was a horrible sight . Twelve feet tall , its skin was a dull , granite\ gray , its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head\ perched on top like a coconut .

There are\ some things you ca n't share without ending up liking each other , and\ knocking out a twelve - foot mountain troll is one of them.\ \ \ CHAPTER ELEVEN\ \ QUIDDITCH\ \ As they entered November , the weather turned very cold . The mountains\ around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel . Every\ morning the ground was covered in frost . Hagrid could be seen from the\ upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field , bundled\ up in a long moleskin overcoat , rabbit fur gloves , and enormous\ beaverskin boots.\ \ The Quidditch season had begun . On Saturday , Harry would be playing in\ his first match after weeks of training : Gryffindor versus Slytherin . If\ Gryffindor won , they would move up into second place in the house\ championship.\ \ Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that , as\ their secret weapon , Harry should be kept , well , secret . But the news\ that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow , and Harry did n't know\ which was worse -- people telling him he 'd be brilliant or people\ telling him they 'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.\ \ It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend . He didn't\ know how he 'd have gotten through all his homework without her , what\ with all the last - minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do . She\ had also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages , which turned out to be a\ very interesting read.\ \ Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a\ Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup\ match in 1473 ; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest\ players , and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to\ them ; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch , referees had\ been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.\ \ Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry\ and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll , and she was much nicer\ for it . The day before Harry 's first Quidditch match the three of them\ were out in the freezing courtyard during break , and she had conjured\ them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.\ They were standing with their backs to it , getting warm , when Snape\ crossed the yard . Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping . Harry,\ Ron , and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view;\ they were sure it would n't be allowed . Unfortunately , something about\ their guilty faces caught Snape 's eye . He limped over . He had n't seen\ the fire , but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off\ anyway.\ \ "
57778	57791	57773	57773	you	1746	Potter?"\ \ It was Quidditch Through the Ages . Harry showed him.\ \ "

57858	57905	57850	57850	I	0	" said Ron bitterly.\ \ The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening . Harry , Ron , and\ Hermione sat together next to a window . Hermione was checking Harry and\ Ron 's Charms homework for them . She would never let them copy ( "
57911	57980	57908	57908	you	1749	" ) , but by asking her to read it through , they got the right\ answers anyway.\ \ Harry felt restless . He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back , to take\ his mind off his nerves about tomorrow . Why should he be afraid of\ Snape ? Getting up , he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if\ he could have it.\ \ "
57986	58093	57908	57908	you	1749	" they said together , but Harry had an idea that\ Snape would n't refuse if there were other teachers listening.\ \ He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked . There was no answer.\ He knocked again . Nothing.\ \ Perhaps Snape had left the book in there ? It was worth a try . He pushed\ the door ajar and peered inside -- and a horrible scene met his eyes.\ \ Snape and Filch were inside , alone . Snape was holding his robes above\ his knees . One of his legs was bloody and mangled . Filch was handing\ Snape bandages.\ \ "
58098	58103	57908	57908	you	1749	" Snape was saying . "

The trouble was , it was very hard to know where to\ begin , not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a\ book . He was n't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century , or Notable\ Magical Names of Our Time ; he was missing , too , from Important Modern\ Magical Discoveries , and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry . And\ then , of course , there was the sheer size of the library ; tens of\ thousands of books ; thousands of shelves ; hundreds of narrow rows.\ \ Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to\ search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them\ off the shelves at random . Harry wandered over to the Restricted\ Section . He had been wondering for a while if Flamel was n't somewhere in\ there . Unfortunately , you needed a specially signed note from one of the\ teachers to look in any of the restricted books , and he knew he 'd never\ get one . These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never\ taught at Hogwarts , and only read by older students studying advanced\ Defense Against the Dark Arts.\ \ "

He , Ron , and Hermione had already agreed they 'd better not\ ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel . They were sure she 'd be\ able to tell them , but they could n't risk Snape hearing what they were\ up to.\ \ Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found\ anything , but he was n't very hopeful . They had been looking for two\ weeks , after A , but as they only had odd moments between lessons it\ was n't surprising they 'd found nothing . What they really needed was a\ nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.\ \ Five minutes later , Ron and Hermione joined him , shaking their heads.\ They went off to lunch.\ \ "

They had the dormitory to themselves and the\ common room was far emptier than usual , so they were able to get the\ good armchairs by the fire . They sat by the hour eating anything they\ could spear on a toasting fork -- bread , English muffins , marshmallows\ -- and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled , which were fun to talk\ about even if they would n't work.\ \ Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess . This was exactly like\ Muggle chess except that the figures were alive , which made it a lot\ like directing troops in battle . Ron 's set was very old and battered.\ Like everything else he owned , it had once belonged to someone else in\ his family -- in this case , his grandfather . However , old chessmen\ were n't a drawback at all . Ron knew them so well he never had trouble\ getting them to do what he wanted.\ \ Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him , and they didn't\ trust him at all . He was n't a very good player yet and they kept\ shouting different bits of advice at him , which was confusing . "
63450	63507	63441	63441	him	1832	" On Christmas Eve , Harry went to bed looking forward to the next\ day for the food and the fun , but not expecting any presents at all.\ When he woke early in the morning , however , the first thing he saw was a\ small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.\ \ "
63511	63527	63528	63528	You	0	" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and\ pulled on his bathrobe.\ \ "

It was wrapped in thick brown paper and\ scrawled across it was To Harry , from Hagrid . Inside was a roughly cut\ wooden flute . Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself . Harry blew it --\ it sounded a bit like an owl.\ \ A second , very small parcel contained a note.\ \ We received your message and enclose your Christmas present . From Uncle\ Vernon and Aunt Petunia . Taped to the note was a fifty - pence piece.\ \ "
63670	63682	63528	63528	You	0	" said Harry.\ \ Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.\ \ "

There was a note pinned to it:\ \ Just in case.\ \ \ CHAPTER SIXTEEN\ \ THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR\ \ In years to come , Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to\ get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting\ through the door at any moment . Yet the days crept by , and there could\ be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.\ \ It was sweltering hot , especially in the large classroom where they did\ their written papers . They had been given special , new quills for the\ exams , which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.\ \ They had practical exams as well . Professor Flitwick called them one by\ one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across\ a desk . Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox\ -- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was , but taken away if\ it had whiskers . Snape made them all nervous , breathing down their necks\ while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.\ \ Harry did the best he could , trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his\ forehead , which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the\ forest . Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because\ Harry could n't sleep , but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by\ his old nightmare , except that it was now worse than ever because there\ was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.\ \ Maybe it was because they had n't seen what Harry had seen in the forest,\ or because they did n't have scars burning on their foreheads , but Ron\ and Hermione did n't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry . The idea\ of Voldemort certainly scared them , but he did n't keep visiting them in\ dreams , and they were so busy with their studying they did n't have much\ time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.\ \ Their very last exam was History of Magic . One hour of answering\ questions about batty old wizards who 'd invented selfstirring cauldrons\ and they 'd be free , free for a whole wonderful week until their exam\ results came out . When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put\ down their quills and roll up their parchment , Harry could n't help\ cheering with the rest.\ \ "

In an instant , the green hangings became scarlet\ and the silver became gold ; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a\ towering Gryffindor lion took its place . Snape was shaking Professor\ McGonagall 's hand , with a horrible , forced smile . He caught Harry 's eye\ and Harry knew at once that Snape 's feelings toward him had n't changed\ one jot . This did n't worry Harry . It seemed as though life would be back\ to normal next year , or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.\ \ It was the best evening of Harry 's life , better than winning at\ Quidditch , or Christmas , or knocking out mountain trolls ... he would\ never , ever forget tonight.\ \ Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come , but\ come they did . To their great surprise , both he and Ron passed with good\ marks ; Hermione , of course , had the best grades of the first years . Even\ Neville scraped through , his good Herbology mark making up for his\ abysmal Potions one . They had hoped that Goyle , who was almost as stupid\ as he was mean , might be thrown out , but he had passed , too . It was a\ shame , but as Ron said , you could n't have everything in life.\ \ And suddenly , their wardrobes were empty , their trunks were packed,\ Neville 's toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets ; notes were\ handed out to all students , warning them not to use magic over the\ holidays ( "

A wizened\ old guard was up by the ticket barrier , letting them go through the gate\ in twos and threes so they did n't attract attention by all bursting out\ of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.\ \ "
